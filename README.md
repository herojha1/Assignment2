# Assignment2
# Project Overview
The sysopctl project is designed to provide a custom command-line tool for managing system resources, processes, and services on a Linux system. The script, written in Bash, enhances system administration capabilities by consolidating common administrative tasks into a single command.

# Command Name: sysopctl
# Version: v0.1.0
# Language: Bash
# Platform: Linux

# Problem Solving Approach
1. Requirement Analysis:
Understand the key requirements from the customer:
Basic system monitoring and resource management features.
Ease of use with a single command (sysopctl).
Clear documentation and help options.
Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.
2. Design & Architecture:
Design the script structure to include:
Basic functionalities (help, version, system service management).
Intermediate functionalities (disk usage, process monitoring).
Advanced functionalities (log analysis, system backup).
Plan for scalability and future enhancements.
3. Implementation:
Write the sysopctl script following best practices in Bash scripting.
Implement error handling and user feedback for better usability.
4. Testing:
Perform unit testing for each![364042140-df12a0e8-7f67-4dbc-abec-6495e1833b21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e363bc17-97ef-4a98-8058-a1e4d5cb11c6)
 functionality.
Test the script in various system environments to ensure compatibility.
5. Documentation & Version Control:
Document the entire project, including the command usage, setup instructions, and system architecture.
Use a private Git repository for version control.
System Architecture and Workflow
System Architecture Diagram
A system architecture diagram can be created using Draw.io to illustrate the flow and components involved in the sysopctl script. Below is a description of what the diagram would include:

# User Interaction:

User invokes the sysopctl command with specific options.
The command-line interface (CLI) processes the input and routes it to the appropriate function.
Core Functional Modules:

Command Parser:
Parses the input arguments and determines the operation (e.g., service start, disk usage).
System Service Manager:
Handles starting, stopping, and listing services.
System Monitor:
Monitors system load, processes, and disk usage.
Log Analyzer:
Analyzes critical log entries using journalctl.
Backup Manager:
Executes file backup operations using rsync.
Output:

The results are displayed to the user via the CLI.
Workflow Diagram
A workflow diagram created in Draw.io would include:

Start:
User invokes the sysopctl command.
Command Parsing:
Identify the subcommand (service, system, disk, process, logs, backup).
Execute Action:
Based on the subcommand, execute the appropriate function.
Return Result:
Display the output to the user.
End:
Implementation Details
Command Features
Help Option (--help):

Provides usage instructions and examples.
Accessible via sysopctl --help.
Version Information (--version):

Displays the current version of the command.
Accessible via sysopctl --version.
Service Management:

List Services: sysopctl service list
Start Service: sysopctl service start <service-name>
Stop Service: sysopctl service stop <service-name>
System Monitoring:

View Load: sysopctl system load
Disk Usage: sysopctl disk usage
Process Monitoring: sysopctl process monitor
Log Analysis:

Analyze Logs: sysopctl logs analyze
Backup Management:

Backup Files: sysopctl backup <path>
Manual Page
The manual page for sysopctl provides detailed documentation of the command. It is stored in a file named sysopctl.1 and can be accessed using the man command.

# Version Control
Repository Structure
The project is stored in a private Git repository with the following structure:

![363970401-894db46f-3b59-4373-bab2-f5dc9bbd5aef](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2727688d-662d-46c8-b08a-9c4b2bce8d43)

Versioning Strategy
Versioning Format: Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
Initial Release: v0.1.0
Git Tags: Use Git tags to mark significant releases.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Operating System: Linux
Dependencies: Bash, systemctl, rsync, journalctl
Installation Steps
Clone the Repository:
git clone <private-repo-url>
bash
Copy code
git clone <private-repo-url>
Place the Script:

Move the script to a directory in your PATH:
bash
Copy code
sudo mv sysopctl/src/sysopctl /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sysopctl
Manual Page Setup:

Copy the manual page:
bash
Copy code
sudo cp sysopctl/docs/sysopctl.1 /usr/local/man/man1/
sudo mandb
Test the Installation:

Run a basic command:
bash
Copy code
sysopctl --version
Usage Examples
Service Management
List all running services:

bash
Copy code
sysopctl service list
Start a service (e.g., apache2):

bash
Copy code
sysopctl service start apache2
System Monitoring
View system load:

bash
Copy code
sysopctl system load
Monitor processes:

bash
Copy code
sysopctl process monitor
Backup Files

Copy code
sysopctl backup /etc
Further Enhancements
Future improvements could include:

Interactive Mode: Allow users to interact with the script in an interactive mode.
Additional Monitoring Tools: Integrate advanced monitoring tools like htop or glances.
Automated Backups: Implement a scheduling mechanism for regular backups.
